# ApproachMDPproject
A toolbox as a result of a class project in CS221: Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University.

Open MDPdemo.py or ProjectDemo.ipynb to generate trajectories based on the stored example policy.

util.py, projectUtil.py, csv2dict.py are libraries used by the demos and don't need to be changed.
CS221Project_ApproachMDP.ipynb is the recommended file to generate new policies through the value iteration algorithm.

Please feel free to generate new policies or make improvements.
